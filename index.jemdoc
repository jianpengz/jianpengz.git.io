== Biography
I received my PhD degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), China, in 2022, 
under the supervision of Prof. [https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/yongxia.html Yong Xia]. 
I was also a research fellow at the Australia Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide (UoA), Australia, jointly work with Dr. [https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/johan.verjans\#my-research Johan Verjans]. Before that, I was a visitor at UoA under the supervision of Prof. [https://cshen.github.io/ Chunhua Shen]. 

My research interests span a broad spectrum in the medical AI domain, including but not limited to self-supervised learning, partial label learning, and vision-language pre-training. The core objective of my work is to harness the potential of AI technology in clinical environments, thereby enhancing its value through direct applications that benefit healthcare professionals and patients alike.

==== We are recruiting interns with a passion and research background in medical image analysis or computer vision. If you are interested, please send me your resume.
