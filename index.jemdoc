== Biography
I received my PhD degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), China, in 2022, 
under the supervision of Prof. [https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/yongxia.html Yong Xia]. 
I was also a research fellow at the Australia Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide (UoA), Australia, jointly work with Dr. [https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/johan.verjans\#my-research Johan Verjans]. Before that, I was a visitor at UoA under the supervision of Prof. [https://cshen.github.io/ Chunhua Shen]. 

My research interests mainly focus on deep learning technologies for medical image analysis, 
especially annotation-limited 3D medical image segmentation.
